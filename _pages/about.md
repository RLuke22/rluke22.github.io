I am a Ph.D. student in the [Robotics and Embodied AI Lab (REAL) Lab](https://montrealrobotics.ca) at Mila / Université de Montréal, advised by Prof. [Liam Paull](https://liampaull.ca) and Prof. [Chris Pal](https://sites.google.com/view/christopher-pal). 
My research interests lie at the intersection of artificial intelligence and autonomous vehicles, with a particular emphasis on data-driven simulation, edge-case generation, and end-to-end autonomy. I believe that simulation will play an increasingly vital role in scaling Level 4+ autonomous vehicles, and am particularly excited about the role that generative models can play in make driving simulators more realistic and controllable.

During my Ph.D., I did an internship at [Torc Robotics](https://torc.ai) on generative models for data-driven simulation, working closely with [Roger Girgis](https://www.linkedin.com/in/roger-girgis-a46b959b/?originalSubdomain=ca) and [Felix Heide](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~fheide/). 


<!-- Prior to this, I obtained an M.S. in Robotics from Carnegie Mellon University, where I was fortunate to work with Prof. [David Held](https://davheld.github.io/) and Prof. [Martial Hebert](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~hebert/). I received my Bachelor's degree from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, where I have been lucky to work with Prof. [Chi-Keung Tang](http://www.cs.ust.hk/~cktang/bio-sketch-review.htm) and Prof. [Yu-Wing Tai](https://www.cse.ust.hk/admin/people/faculty/profile/yuwing). I also had an internship at [Tencent Youtu Lab](https://open.youtu.qq.com/#/open).  -->
