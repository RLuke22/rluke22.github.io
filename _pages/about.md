I am a Master's student in Robotics at Carnegie Mellon University, where I am fortunate to work in the [R-Pad Lab](https://r-pad.github.io/) with [Prof. David Held](https://davheld.github.io/) and [Prof. Martial Hebert](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~hebert/). My current research interest lies in computer vision and robot learning. 

Prior to joining CMU, I spent four wonderful years in [Hong Kong Unviersity of Science and Technology](https://www.ust.hk/home), where I have been lucky to work with [Prof. Chi-Keung Tang](http://www.cs.ust.hk/~cktang/bio-sketch-review.htm) and [Prof. Yu-Wing Tai](https://www.cse.ust.hk/admin/people/faculty/profile/yuwing) in computer vision and style transfer. I also had an internship in [Tencent Youtu Lab](https://open.youtu.qq.com/#/open). 

I have a great passion about making robots that perceives the world like human do, and I am apply for CS Ph.D. program for Fall 2021. Feel free to contact me!
