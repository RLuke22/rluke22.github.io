I am a Ph.D. student in [Robot Vision & Learning (RVL) Lab](https://rvl.cs.toronto.edu/) at University of Toronto, advised by Prof. [Florian Shkurti](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~florian/). Prior to this, I obtained a M.S. in Robotics from Carnegie Mellon University, where I had fortunate to work with Prof. [David Held](https://davheld.github.io/) and Prof. [Martial Hebert](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~hebert/). I received my Bachelor's degree from Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, where I have been lucky to work with Prof. [Chi-Keung Tang](http://www.cs.ust.hk/~cktang/bio-sketch-review.htm) and Prof. [Yu-Wing Tai](https://www.cse.ust.hk/admin/people/faculty/profile/yuwing). I also had an internship in [Tencent Youtu Lab](https://open.youtu.qq.com/#/open). 

I am currently doing a Research Scientist Internship at Meta Reality Labs. 

My research interest lies in 3D computer vision and robotics. I am especially excited by perception algorithms that can generalize and adapt, and their applications in the robotic domain.
